# SchoolBot

This is the open-source code behind [SchoolBot](https://schoolbot.io), a web app
created by [Vermonster](http://www.vermonster.com) that parents and guardians of
students can use to track school bus locations.

School districts interested in offering SchoolBot have two options: Deploy and
maintain this code on their own servers, or purchase a subscription to
**schoolbot.io**, a deployment of SchoolBot hosted and supported by Vermonster.

## schoolbot.io

Our hosted SchoolBot service is available to any school district that meets the
basic requirements. Please contact us at <schoolbot@vermonster.com> for pricing.

## Requirements

Regardless of whether you subscribe to the schoolbot.io service or host your own
installation of SchoolBot, the basic requirements are:

1. School buses must be tracked using [Zonar Ground Traffic Control][zonargtc].
2. Students must be assigned to buses in your student information system using
   a unique bus identifier that is also present in Zonar.
3. You must have a way of regularly exporting (and anonymizing) bus assignment
   data from your student information system to the SchoolBot API.
